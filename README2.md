## Description

Metis was a mythical Titaness who became the goddess of wisdom, prudence and ingenuity. Ingenuity being the "practical, complex and implicit" kind differs from the other types of wisdom.

Likewise, this project targets the efficient and aesthetically pleasing numerical computation of dynamical systems being subject to holonomic constraints: particle systems as well as rigid body systems.

#### Features

- Coding Language: MATLAB
- Object-oriented
- Postprocessing includes [matlab2tikz](https://github.com/matlab2tikz/matlab2tikz)
