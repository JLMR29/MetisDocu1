# METIS - Computing constrained mechanical systems

_a project by Philipp L. Kinon_

## Background

 Metis was a mythical Titaness who became the goddess of wisdom, prudence and ingenuity. Ingenuity being the "practical, complex and implicit" kind differs from the other types of wisdom.

 Likewise, this project targets the efficient and aesthetically pleasing numerical computation of dynamical systems being subject to holonomic constraints: particle systems as well as rigid body systems.

 Metis was mainly initialised by Philipp Kinon, B.Sc. during his master thesis at the _Institute of Mechanics (IFM)_ at _Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT)_, Germany.
