## Description

Metis was a mythical Titaness who became the goddess of wisdom, prudence and ingenuity. Ingenuity being the "practical, complex and implicit" kind differs from the other types of wisdom.

Likewise, this project targets the efficient and aesthetically pleasing numerical computation of dynamical systems being subject to holonomic constraints: particle systems as well as rigid body systems.

#### Features

- Coding Language: MATLAB
- Object-oriented
- Postprocessing includes [matlab2tikz](https://github.com/matlab2tikz/matlab2tikz)

#### Theoretical Background

- Initial Value Problems (IVP) of Constrained Dynamics leading to Differential-algebraic Equations (DAEs)
- Numerical Integration (Direct Methods, Variational Integrators, Energy-Momentum Schemes)
- Newton-Rhapson Method
- Particle Systems
- Rigid Body Dynamics with Director Formulation

## How To Start

1. Clone this directory
2. Open the [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) editor or run it with the shell script [metis.sh](metis.sh)
2. Execute [metis_start.m](metis_start.m) for a first simulation (or [metis_error_analysis.m](metis_error_analysis.m) for an error analysis)
3. Edit or change input file in [/input](/input) or create a new one

## Acknowledgement

Metis was mainly initialised by Philipp L. Kinon during his master thesis at the [_Institute of Mechanics (IFM)_](https://www.ifm.kit.edu/english/index.php) at [_Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT)_](https://www.kit.edu/english/), Germany. This project would not have been possible without the support of others:
